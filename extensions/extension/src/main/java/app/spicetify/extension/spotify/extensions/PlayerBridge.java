 * <p>
 * Threading: the router answers on Spotify's core thread. There a callback only copies the body
 * and posts it to the one bridge thread, so it never blocks the core, and every {@link Result} and
 * {@link StateListener} runs on the bridge thread. Nothing may block that thread either: a wait is
 * a {@link #postDelayed}. Spotify may hold callbacks weakly, so the bridge keeps each live one in
 * {@link #LIVE} until it answers or is cancelled.
 * <p>
 * When Spotify replaces its router, calls still waiting on the old one fail with "bridge not
 * connected", so a {@link Result} can arrive as a failure on router loss. A state stream that ends,
 * answers an error status, or that Spotify won't open, opens again after a backoff while anything
 * listens.
