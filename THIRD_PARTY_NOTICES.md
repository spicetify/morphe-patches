# Third-party sources

This repository retains the upstream GPL-3.0 license and Morphe NOTICE.
The following revisions document the source used for the first milestone.

## Morphe patch template

The repository began with
[MorpheApp/morphe-patches-template](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches-template/tree/f99b2938bd25b202a6185a774d487a07d1061915)
at `f99b2938bd25b202a6185a774d487a07d1061915`, under GPL-3.0 and its NOTICE.
Build files, the Gradle wrapper, and release tooling originate there.
September 17, 2026 modifications replace example patches, project metadata,
documentation, and issue forms, and add tests and release verification gates.

## Historical Spotify implementations

[anddea/revanced-patches](https://github.com/anddea/revanced-patches/tree/3174510163d9787571bd93275b54932b575f82ed)
at `3174510163d9787571bd93275b54932b575f82ed` provides the GPL-3.0 historical
reference for these features:

- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/spotify/layout/theme/CustomThemePatch.kt`
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/spotify/misc/privacy/Fingerprints.kt`
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/spotify/misc/privacy/SanitizeSharingLinksPatch.kt`
- `extensions/shared/src/main/java/app/revanced/extension/spotify/misc/privacy/SanitizeSharingLinksPatch.java`

The theme's color map starts from that implementation's resource selection
and extends it to the colors listed in `patches/src/main/resources/theme/`,
checked against Spotify 9.1.80.2221. The patch requires each mapped color
exactly once, edits no color values, and declares the mapped colors
overlayable. It does not import the historical extension, animation hooks, or
icon assets.

The sharing implementation uses a new fingerprint for Spotify 9.1.80.2221's
URL builder. Its new Java helper removes named tracking parameters while
preserving other query parameters and fragments, instead of truncating the
query. These adaptations were made on September 17, 2026.

No code from binary-only candidates was imported. Spotify APKs and other
proprietary assets are excluded.

## Morphe theme overlay

`ThemeOverlay.java` ports the self-targeting overlay technique of Morphe's
[`ThemeColorOverlay.java`](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches/blob/86e146c54bad8450265f2ac2d734722fd682794c/extensions/shared-youtube/library/src/main/java/app/morphe/extension/shared/theme/ThemeColorOverlay.java)
in MorpheApp/morphe-patches (GPL-3.0 with the Morphe NOTICE this repository
retains), at `86e146c54bad8450265f2ac2d734722fd682794c`. Its header keeps
Morphe's copyright and notice reference. `ThemeRuntime.java` follows Morphe in
registering the overlay on every start, because Android deletes an app's own
overlays when it is installed again. Local changes, made on September 25,
2026: one overlay for all mapped Spotify colors instead of separate dark and
light background overlays, a single shared `ResourcesLoader` that is updated
in place, and loading through activity lifecycle callbacks instead of
Morphe's base-context hook. On October 2, 2026: each update closes the
provider it replaces.

## APK reverse engineering skill

`.agents/skills/apk-reverse` contains the skill directory from
[newliver666/apk-reverse](https://github.com/newliver666/apk-reverse/tree/7b6c6932a95f03d778e81e5e1a2cbf6f62dc97fd)
at `7b6c6932a95f03d778e81e5e1a2cbf6f62dc97fd`, under the MIT license.
The upstream copyright and license are retained in the skill's
[LICENSE](.agents/skills/apk-reverse/LICENSE). The imported files are unchanged;
`UPSTREAM.json` records their provenance. This development tool is separate
from the patch bundle and Android extension.
