## [1.1.0](https://github.com/spicetify/morphe-patches/compare/v1.0.1...v1.1.0) (2026-10-03)

Spicetify Android patches 1.1.0 targets **Spotify 9.1.80.2221, ARM64**. Other Spotify versions are not supported. Themes require Android 11 or later.

Changes in this release:

- Apply themes through Spicetify color roles, with presets, custom colors, and migration of previously saved themes.
- Paste colors from a Spicetify `color.ini` or CSS theme.
- Browse community themes in the Spicetify Marketplace, with search, previews, and a cached list.
- Apply theme background images, including Galaxy V2, with optional blur.
- Open Spicetify settings without adding a manifest Activity, and hide server files on mount installations that cannot support their separate process.

The Spotify 9.1.88 port and analytics and attestation experiments are archived and are not included in this release.

Download [patches-1.1.0.mpp](https://github.com/spicetify/morphe-patches/releases/download/v1.1.0/patches-1.1.0.mpp), or update the Spicetify source in Morphe Manager.
